# Simple-SQLPython-Form
The python code builds a GUI that acts a simple application form, where the user inserts their names and email and that's all saved in a SQL database. 
Ofcourse the creator of the form must first create a table in their database, which is what I did in the Data_stored.sql file
This code serves to show MySQL and Python integration where I use OOP in python to retrieve data using the Kivy library and the SQL server stores it.

I recommend using your own SQL server credentials inplace of mine, since ofcourse I can't share mine publicly.
